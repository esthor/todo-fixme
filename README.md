# // TODO // FIXME -- Real Strategies to Modernize a React (or React Native) App

This repo is a collection of materials for a talk I gave at Chain React 2024.

Besides the slide deck, this repo is a collection of useful scripts for addressing tech debt and modernizing legacy React and React Native projects.

Each area of focus has its own folder. And each comes with a simple set of "pitches" you can use or adapt to your needs to clarify and convince your team / managers / company of the need to spend time on any given modernization project.

As developers, we all have interacted with legacy code, patterns, and systems. It's a painful reality and experience we all share. But, we can also look at it in a postive way: Our industry is always evolving at a rapid pace and amazing folks everywhere are always coming up with better ways to build great software.

Cheers to all of you brave adventurers pushing the frontiers of better software engineering. You lift us all up.
